TIP:
====
sh execute.sh to compile and build zephyr.strip file

IO3 is configured both as GPIO OUT and PWM
IO1 is configured as GPIO IN
So connect IO3 and IO1 and load zephyr for all questions

Viewing Outputs:
================
Shell name is cse522.
[1]select cse522
[2]qsn1 - to view interrupt latencies without background computing
[3]qsn2 - to view interrupt latencies with background computing
[4]qsn3 - to view context switch times
